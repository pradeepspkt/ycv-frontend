                  tools to know more about Crypto. We are not financial advisors but we present our
                  report with all the community engagement. We continuously try to block all the
                  fake and spam votes but sometimes the voting might not be 100% correct. ALWAYS do
                  your own research (DYOR), you are responsible for your own investments.</span>

                 Even when a crypto seems safe
                  because of honeypot checks, audits, scans etc, it can turn out to be a scam. Take
                  your time to understand what you are investing into. The sponsored tokens or
                  Cryptos are shown in the sectors because it has been paid and we try our best to
                  not list the token which we feel unsafe to our investors but your own research is
                  very important.
